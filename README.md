# Unturned Bypass Hash Verification
For some mods on the Steam Workshop, you cant equip the items, say if its a gun of some sorts. You can place it in your hands, but not visually and actually use the item itself. That's because of something I'm too lazy to research but I found a fix and stuck the fix into a small little C# Windows program that will apply the fix for you without you having to deal with every file its self!
